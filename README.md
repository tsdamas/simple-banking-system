Welcome to Simple Banking System project! This is a project of a basic banking system to practice object oriented programming. 

## Description

This basic banking system allows the owner of the account to deposit and withdraw money from their account. This project aims to practice the following concepts: 

- [encapsulation] keep the class attributes private and provide public methods to access and modify them  
- [inheritance] create subclasses from Acount class, such us SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount
- [polymorphism] implements methods that behave differenly based on the object type. For example, TFSASavingsAccount have an different interest rate than SavingsAccount.
